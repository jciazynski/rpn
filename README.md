# Reverse Polish Notation
This code shows my first contact with Object Oriented Programming in Python. 
Reverse Polish notation (Postfix notation) differs from normal (Infix) notation, because instead of 3 + 2, we write 3 2 +. Additionaly, in this program, adding, and subtracting goes before multiplying and dividing. So, instead of ( 3 * 6 + 2 ) + ( 14 / 3 + 4 ), we have 3 6 2 + * 14 3 4 + / +, and the result is not 28.67, but 26.
